<h1> Band 'The Tropics' is Back in Town </h1>
<p> Our town's world famous band <em> 'The Tropics' </em> is back in town! After their latest world tour for their new album <i> 'The Van' </i> they have finally returned to their hometown of Sheffield, UK. <i> 'The Van' </i> was actually the band's first album in almost four years. They were reported to have returned Sunday night as they were spotted at a local bar. </p>

<p> The rumor around town is that the album was created by the lead singer, Alec Burner, after his latest heartbreak. Burner was reportedly seeing a girl by the name of Elise Richard who lives in a nearby city. They were seen together a number of times last summer, and it seems like the heartbreak was the inspiration for the new album. </p>

<h2> Quotes from the Artists </h2>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Alexia Steele</b></br>
<I>Owner</I></br>
In the heart of Panama City Beach, Florida, I, Alexia Steele, brought to life the vision of Bean Bliss Cafe, a coastal sanctuary fusing the world-class allure of coffee with the laid-back charm of the Gulf. From the sun-drenched coffee farms of Central America to our sandy shores, Bean Bliss has evolved into a community hub, where each meticulously crafted blend tells a story of shared moments, laughter, and the beauty of our Gulf views. Beyond a coffee destination, Bean Bliss is a testament to the magic that unfolds when dreams, patience, and a touch of coastal spirit converge. At the heart of our success lies a diverse and passionate team, a blend of personalities as rich as our coffee, working harmoniously to create an inclusive haven where every customer feels not just welcomed, but truly at home. We cherish not only the art of coffee but also the relationships fostered within our walls, appreciating both the dedicated staff and the wonderful customers who make Bean Bliss the vibrant and welcoming space it is today. This has been a life-long dream of mine and I have you to thank, so thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
